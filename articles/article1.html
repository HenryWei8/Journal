            As renewable energy (RE) rapidly integrates into society to meet the
            growing demand for affordable and clean energy (SDG 7, United
            Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 7), it is crucial to analyze
            the merits and flaws of renewable energy generation by assessing its
            impact on the global economy and social wellbeing. This paper
            performs an investigative study on the correlation and causality
            between renewable energy, economy, and environmental indicators. The
            data was gathered from diverse sources, including The Center for
            Climate and Energy Solutions, National Aeronautics and Space
            Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA GISS), and
            Our World in Data, for the temperature, carbon dioxide (CO2)
            emissions, and gross domestic product (GDP) data. Significant
            Granger p-values were obtained for RE generation’s ability to
            forecast CO2 emissions and temperature while discovering a strong
            positive correlation between CO2 and RE generation. The findings
            revealed that RE has limited effects on the global economy but has
            considerable implications on social and ecological wellbeing.
