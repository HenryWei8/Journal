              Evidence, in the form of facts and materials, is crucial in
              proving the truth of a matter in court. Oral testimonies, which
              are verbal statements made by witnesses during legal proceedings,
              serve as a key method of gathering evidence. In assessing these
              testimonies, judges closely examine both the content of the
              evidence and the witness’s background to evaluate credibility and
              reliabil- ity. Reliability hinges on the testimony’s quality and
              accuracy, while credibility is influenced by the witness’s
              objectivity and competence. Objectivity is gauged by considering
              factors like bias, integrity, and demeanor. Competence,
              conversely, is determined by the witness’s mental state, language
              proficiency, memory, and other elements that may affect their
              ability to provide reliable testimony. However, the delivery of
              evidence is prone to bias. For example, while objectivity aspects
              are to some degree in the conscious command of a witness, the
              issues of competence are mostly outside of the witness’ control.
              As a result, evaluation of the evidence is made extremely
              difficult by the subjective and uncontrollable nature of oral
              testimonies. To prove the defendant’s guilt “beyond reasonable
              doubt,” judges must first presume innocence. This task becomes
              more complex when the primary evidence is derived from oral
              testimonies, where the judge’s subjective perception may lie at
              the heart of the matter.
