          <p class="abstract1">
            There is a multitude of languages spoken worldwide, yet English has
            emerged as the predominant one, widely accepted as the international
            standard. However, not everyone can communicate through this
            “standard”. Even if they can, they may not communicate at the level
            of proficiency comparable to someone from America or England. Most
            of the people who are classified as having the ability to speak
            English are not from either of these regions, thus not indulging in
            the “standard” that the world keeps as a form of universal
            communication. The social norm is to speak English with some level
            of an American accent, resulting in that being the national language
            spoken without it being declared as the official one by the
            government. The principle is when speaking with anyone unknown
            everyone is “assumed” to know at least English. Individuals speak
            with their variation and accent, which come from the country/region
            of which they are from. Thus, they will naturally have speech that
            is distinctly different not only from the “Standard American
            English”, but also from other countries/communities' versions of
            English. Due to this predicament, there is a challenge for those
            speaking with different accents and variations to speak with one
            another, even if everyone is doing so in what they have learned in
            English.
