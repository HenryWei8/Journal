            <p>
              There is a multitude of languages spoken worldwide, yet English
              has emerged as the predominant one, widely accepted as the
              international standard. However, not everyone can communicate
              through this “standard”. Even if they can, they may not
              communicate at the level of proficiency comparable to someone from
              America or England. Most of the people who are classified as
              having the ability to speak English are not from either of these
              regions, thus not indulging in the “standard” that the world keeps
              as a form of universal communication. The social norm is to speak
              English with some level of an American accent, resulting in that
              being the national language spoken without it being declared as
              the official one by the government. The principle is when speaking
              with anyone unknown everyone is “assumed” to know at least
              English. Individuals speak with their variation and accent, which
              come from the country/region of which they are from. Thus, they
              will naturally have speech that is distinctly different not only
              from the “Standard American English”, but also from other
              countries/communities' versions of English. Due to this
              predicament, there is a challenge for those speaking with
              different accents and variations to speak with one another, even
              if everyone is doing so in what they have learned in English.
